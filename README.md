# Simulation of a Simplified Query Processor
This is a python application simulating a simplified query processor that accesses data from the partitioned database

1. Range Query - returns all tuples from range partitions matching the input range (min-max)
2. Point Query - returns all tuples from range or round-robin partitions matching the input value
